# Introduction


Welcome to LoopTips!  The purpose of these pages is to help you make the most of your DIY closed-looping experience.  In particular, these pages support users of the [Loop app](https://loopdocs.org).  These documents have been a long time in the making and as always, your feedback is welcome.  If you have comments, please feel free to provide input at the [Looped Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheLoopedGroup/?fref=nf)  or in [Loop's Zulipchat](https://loop.zulipchat.com).

LoopTips is a companion to the LoopDocs.   LoopTips does not cover the build or installation of Loop app.  If you have problems with building your Loop app, or troubleshooting the technical aspects of Loop operations, please head over to the [LoopDocs](https://loopdocs.org) for help.  The pages here are specifically related to understanding how your loop is recommending the actions being taken, and how you can improve your blood glucose outcomes on Loop.

# What is a closed loop?

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a general definition of an "artificial pancreas device system" (aka closed loop system) [on their website](https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/homehealthandconsumer/consumerproducts/artificialpancreas/ucm259548.htm#illustration), quoted below.

>*"Most Artificial Pancreas Device Systems consists of three types of devices already familiar to many people with diabetes: a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) and an insulin infusion pump. A blood glucose device (such as a glucose meter) is used to calibrate the CGM.*

>*A computer-controlled algorithm connects the CGM and insulin infusion pump to allow continuous communication between the two devices. Sometimes an artificial pancreas device system is referred to as a "closed-loop" system, an "automated insulin delivery" system, or an "autonomous system for glycemic control."*

>*An Artificial Pancreas Device System will not only monitor glucose levels in the body but also automatically adjust the delivery of insulin to reduce high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) and minimize the incidence of low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) with little or no input from the patient."*

# What is Loop?

The Loop app is a do-it-yourself closed loop algorithm and user interface, developed through the work of community volunteers. You can read about the history of Loop development in LoopDocs. Loop predicts future blood glucose based on basals, carbohydrate intake, insulin deliveries, and current CGM readings. These blood glucose predictions provide Loop with the information needed to recommend a temporary basal rate to attain a targeted glucose range in the future. The system can either operate as an “open loop” by making recommendations to the user for their approval before enacting or as a “closed loop” by automatically setting the recommended temporary basal rate.

As exciting as this sounds...we should first get the cavaets out of the way.  There are some limitations on what kind of pumps/equipment are required.  This system doesn't work with most pumps and requires you to do some work (directions are thoroughly covered in LoopDocs).

* Loop only works on an iPhone
* Loop only works with older Medtronic pumps and OmniPod Eros pods
* Medtronic x15 series (all work)
* Medtronic x22 series (all work)
* Medtronic x23 series (2.4A or lower)
* Medtronic x54 series (WW: 2.6A or lower and Canadian/Australian: 2.7A or lower)
* OmniPod Eros pods (newer Dash pods are not compatible)
* You need access to a Mac computer to build Loop app onto your iPhone
* You need to buy a RileyLink ($150) and a developer license ($99 per year)

Put in other words, no this does not current work on android phones. Animas, T-slim, Combo, Dana-R, Dana-RS, Medtronic (not listed above), and any other pump you can name will also not be compatible. 

Note: Tidepool Loop has been announced as the development partner for the DASH pods. Timing for the release of Tidepool Loop is still TBD.
